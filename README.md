# Communication-Assistant

A submission for Metaverse Hackaton at Pori 2023

We're developing a program with the following idea and execution plan.

Problem: When listening to lectures or meetings digitally it can be hard to remember, understand and ask questions.

Solution: Live chat connected to chatGPT which updated with the prevalent context. (so users can ask clarifying questions without interrupting speakers)



This solution can be applied to any speech (i.e. podcast, discussion, lectures (live and online), meetings, work).



Business pain: Communicating and understanding.

Sometimes it's hard to remember and understand what is spoken about. Especially if it is a new and difficult subject (business, education or research).
Humans don't want to appear dumb or rude by interrupting the conversation with questions.
"He who asks a question remains a fool for five minutes. He who does not ask remains a fool forever." - Chinese Proverb


Technical specs: Web app with features
speech-to-text API
ChatGPT or open-source
Connect to user data feed (audio, text, etc.)
